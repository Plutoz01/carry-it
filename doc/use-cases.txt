Actors:
- customer
- operator
- driver
- manager
- administrator

Customer:
1. As a customer I want to create a new ORDER. Price should be auto-calculated.
2. As a customer I want to see all MY orders (impleicitly filter to user) with
	- filtering:
		- status
		- date range
		- start location
		- end location
	- sorting:
		- price
		- date
3. As a customer I want to cancel my not yet started orders
4. As a customer I want to be notified from my order status changes in email


Operator:
1. As an operator I want to list all of the orders with
	- filtering (multi-filter with AND between filter type values, single select for each):
		- customer
		- status
		- date range
		- start & end location
		- asssigned vehicle
		- cargo type
	- sorting:
		- date
		- price
2. As an operator I want to assign available vehicles to orders.
	After I've selected a given unassigned order, I want to see the following:
		- cargo details:
			- type & ammount
			- start & end location
			- deadline
		- list of available vehicles ordered by "Vehicle fitting score".
3. As an operator I want to cancel an order and notify the customer with an email


Driver:
1. As a driver I want to see all the orders assigned to me with the following filtered fields:
			- customer name
			- start & end location details
			- cargo type & ammount
			- Planned date
		with filtering:
			- date range
			- simple date selectors, like "past", "upcoming"
2. As a driver I want to get an summary in email from all the details mentioned above from my next day
3. As a driver I want to update the status of a given  order assigned to me (picked-up, done, failed, etc.)


Manager:
1. As a manager I want to get the following reports:
	- Order summary: ammount & price with optional grouping by customers
		Date range should be configurable & there should be some built-in as well:
			- actual month
			- actual week
			- previous month
	- Order details with filtering options to:
		- status
		- date range
		- deadline omission
	

Administrator:
1. As an admin I want to manage (create, list, update and soft-delete):
	- depots
	- vehicles
	- users (with Roles)

Definitions:
	- Vehicle fitting score: this score will be calculated based on the following factors for available vehicles:
		- operational cost (fuel consumption, probably wage for drivers based on driving hours)
		- the distance between the depot & start/stop location -> minimize distance and working hours
		- capacity fitting: avoid waste of free space by assign large capacity vehicles to small cargo
